# keylogger
keylogger assinment in the academy, this is why it is in python and not C/C++ or such,
I did not have a lot of time so it is not the best but it works

it keylogs, turns on in boot, writes the logs to a dropbox.
additonaly it adds to hosts file a location so when tring to go to some academic site it will go to my site,
in my site it will be good because I signed with a certificate and added it to the computer.
